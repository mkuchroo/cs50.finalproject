                Cricket was first played in Southern England as early as the 16th Century. By the 18th Century, it had been adopted by the country as their primary sport 
                and was transported, along with the rest of the English empire, all over the world.  By the mid-19th Century, international matches were being played 
                between countries such as England, Australia, India and South Africa.  Cricket even had a large influence over America and American Culture.  Being the
                favorite sport of America through much of its infancy, American versus England matches took place quite frequently through the 19th century.  After a brief 
                recession, Cricket is now reemerging in America. With many of Cricket leagues spread across the states, hundreds of clubs large tournaments such as American
