    <p align="center">

        Cricket is a bat and ball sport played between two sides of 11 players. Although originally played over a period of 
        5 days, the latest version of the game, as played at Harvard, lasts 3 hours.  The game takes place on an oval field 
        with a 22 yard pitch in the middle.  On this pitch, a bowler, similar to a baseball pitch), must throw a ball overhand 
        while keeping his elbow straight to a batsman from the other team.  The batsman at the other end must defend 3 stumps, 
        or sticks in the ground at the other end.  If the bowler manages to hit these sticks the batsman is out.  Similarly 
        if the batsman hits the ball in the air and is caught by one of the fielding teams players, he is deemed out.  Once 
        all 11 batsmen are out an innings is complete.  The goal of the batsman, however, is also to score runs.  If he hits 
        it over the boundary line, he gets six runs, if even hits it along to ground over to the boundary he get four runs.  
        If the he hits the ball, however it gets fielded before the boundary line, he may run back and forth with a partner of 
        his up and down the pitch, scoring runs one by one.  The team that scores the most runs before all their batsman get 
        out, or with in a particular number of pitches wins.
